This is the shared repository for a handful of very closely-related projects. Please scroll down to the individual notebook file descriptions to get a sense of where code is run from:
* weakly supervised Salient Object Detection (wsSOD) and classification with Patch Convolutional Neural Networks (PatchCNNs) — MISO_filtered.ipynb. Paper: 
* wsSOD robustness with varying degrees of weak supervision — Potentials.ipynb. Paper title forthcoming after submission and review process.
* Multi-scale representation learning (more to come shortly)

 Also feel free to check out my GitHub webpage for more details about projects.
