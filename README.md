This is the shared repository for a handful of very closely-related projects during my dissertation work:
* weakly supervised Salient Object Detection (wsSOD) with PatchCNNs (See MISO) â€” MISO.ipynb
* (more to come)

Please scroll down to the individual notebook file descriptions to get a sense of where code is run from. Also feel free to check out my GitHub webpage for more details about projects.
