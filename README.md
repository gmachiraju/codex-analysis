This is the shared repository for a handful of very closely-related projects. Please scroll down to the individual notebook file descriptions to get a sense of where code is run from. Some of the major projects include:

* weakly supervised Salient Object Detection (wsSOD) and classification with Patch Convolutional Neural Networks (PatchCNNs) 
  — Notebook: MISO_filtered.ipynb.
  - Paper: A Dataset Generation Framework for Evaluating Megapixel Image Classifiers & their Explanations. Gautam Machiraju, Sylvia Plevritis, Parag Mallick. European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2022.
* wsSOD robustness with varying degrees of weak supervision 
  — Notebook: Potentials.ipynb. 
  - Paper: title forthcoming after submission and review process.
* Multi-scale representation learning
  - more to come shortly
