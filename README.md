This is the shared repository for a handful of very closely-related projects during my dissertation work:
* weakly supervised Salient Object Detection (wsSOD) and classification with Patch Convolutional Neural Networks (PatchCNNs) — MISO.ipynb. Paper title forthcoming after review process.
* wsSOD robustness with varying degrees of weak supervision — ProportionSupervision.ipynb (coming soon). Paper title forthcoming after review process.
* (more to come shortly)

Please scroll down to the individual notebook file descriptions to get a sense of where code is run from. Also feel free to check out my GitHub webpage for more details about projects.
